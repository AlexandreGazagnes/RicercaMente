# RicercaMente

## INTRODUCTION

RicercaMENTE is an open source project that aims to trace the history of data science and AI through the most important scientific research published over the years.

## CONTRIBUTE

### How to contribute

1. Find a research that is missing from our list, be sure of its relevance to data science and AI
2. Add your research and fill in all the fields in our table
3. You are a contributor

Attention! we are reconstructing history, so put the searches in chronological order within the table

### Why should you do it?

1. contributing to an open source project is an added asset to your CV, in particular you will demonstrate your knowledge and ability to interpret the scientific literature
2. ethics, you will help those entering the world of data science and AI to retrace the history that led to the current situation, advising them on the best research to understand and comprehend

### Understand the table

- Name = the name of the research
- Author =  the authors of the research
- Year = year of publication
- topic = the topic of the research (insert : AI, MATH, DATA)
- description = A brief description of the research, what is it about?
- Impact = why is it so important?
- Media = where was it published?
- Number of citations = do I have to explain it?
- Tier = enter **Tier 1** if the research completely revolutionised the world of data science or AI, or       enter **Tier 2** if the research made a major contribution but did not disrupt the community
- Link = link to read the research
- More = add whatever you want! this is the only non-compulsory data

## THE HISTORY
| Year | Name | Authors | Topic | Description | Impact | Media | Number of citations | Tier | Link | More |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1928 | On the Theory of Games of Strategy | John von Neumann | MATH | Introduced the concept of extensive-form games and the minimax theorem, establishing foundational principles for game theory. | Pioneering work that laid the groundwork for game theory, influencing diverse fields from economics to AI decision-making algorithms. | Contributions to the Theory of Games | - | 1 | [Link to Paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-52934-0.pdf) | |
| 1948 | A Mathematical Theory of Communication | Claude Shannon | MATH| Proposed the fundamental concepts of information theory, including entropy, channel capacity, and the source coding theorem. Revolutionized the understanding of communication and laid the groundwork for data compression and error correction. | Pioneering work that significantly influenced information theory, data science, and communication systems. | The Bell System Technical Journal | - | 1 | [Link to Paper](http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) | |
| 1950 | Computing Machinery and Intelligence | Alan Turing | AI | Introduced the concept of the Turing Test, a benchmark for determining a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. | Pioneering work that laid the foundation for discussions on machine intelligence and artificial general intelligence (AGI). | Mind | - | 1 | [Link to Paper](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf) |  |
| 2016 | Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search | David Silver et al. | AI | Presented AlphaGo, a model that defeated the European Go champion by 5 games to 0. It uses [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00116992/document) to compute its next move, running simulations of possible outcomes. | Demonstrated that AI can tackle complex challenges and achieve excellence in strategic games | Nature | 17297 | 1 | [Link to Paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf) |  |
| 2017 | Attention is All You Need | Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin | AI | Revealed the transformer, a new neural network that is a significant milestone in modern Deep Learning models. Shaped the way we think about and approach NLP problems. | Has had a profound impact on NLP research and applications | NIPS | 99204 | 1 | [Link to Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) |  |
